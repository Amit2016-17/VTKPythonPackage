Welcome to VTKPythonPackage's documentation!
============================================

This project provides a ``setup.py`` script to build VTK Python wheels.

VTK is an open-source, cross-platform system that provides developers with an extensive suite of software tools for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization.

The Python packages are built daily. To install the VTK Python package::

	$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
	$ python -m pip install vtk

For more information on VTK's Python wrapping, see `VTK Python Wrapping FAQ <http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Python_Wrapping_FAQ>`_.
There are also many `downloadable examples <https://lorensen.github.io/VTKExamples/site/Python/>`_.
